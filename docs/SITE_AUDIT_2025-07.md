| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🛠 Admin Products | `/admin` | ✅ | ✅ | 🟢 Working | Search, image uploads, featured toggle OK |
| 📦 Admin Orders | `/admin` (Orders tab) | ✅ | ✅ | 🟢 Working | Order list + status render correctly |

| 🧠 Assistant Lab | `/assistant` | ✅ | ❌ | 🔴 Offline | "Error connecting to assistant" |
| 📝 AI Editor | `/editor` | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial | 🟡 Barebones | Monaco loads, no assistant tool hookup |
| ✅ Order Success | `/success` | ✅ | ⚠️ Partial | 🟢 Mostly Working | Renders fine; console shows `Missing orderId` |
| 🏠 Home | `/` | ✅ | ✅ | 🟢 Working | Landing page loads as expected |
| 🛍 Store | `/store` | ✅ | ✅ | 🟢 Working | Product listing OK |
| 🔐 Login | `/login` | ✅ | ✅ (dev bypass) | 🟢 Working | Console shows "Dev bypassing authentication" |

---

## 🧠 Assistant System Errors

| Type | Affected Pages | Message Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `502 Bad Gateway` | `/chat`, `/assistant` | Backend assistant unreachable |
| `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` | `/chat`, `/assistant` | HTML being returned where JSON expected (502 page likely) |
| `Missing orderId` | `/success` | Order fetch fails, but confirmation message appears |

---

## 🗄 Redis Status

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Listening | Yes (localhost:6379) |
| Docker Restarted | ✅ – but did not fix assistant issue |
| Binding Scope | Possibly mismatched (container vs host) |

---

## ⚙️ Recommendations (Next Steps)

1. **Assistant Backend Debug**
    - Check API server logs for `/assistant/stream` and `/assistant/msg` endpoints
    - Confirm Redis host is set to `localhost` or correct Docker network alias
2. **Success Page Improvement**
    - Pass `orderId` cleanly from checkout to success page
    - Use query param or cookie fallback
3. **Style/UI Pass Needed On:**
    - `/chat` (theme, layout polish)
    - `/assistant` (terminal interface)
    - `/editor` (floating UI blocks need refining)
4. **Log & Health Reporting**
    - Add health route `/api/assistant/health` with Redis + API pings
    - Integrate uptime/log dashboard

## ✅ Site Section Audit

| Page / Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/admin/products` | ✅ Working | Image upload, search, and filter work; images render fine |
| `/admin/orders` | ✅ Working | Orders visible and functional |
| `/admin/blogposts` | ✅ Working | Blog creation/deletion tested; duplicate slug warning shown properly |
| `/chat` | ⚠️ Assistant Down | UI loads, agent connection fails, 502/JSON parsing errors |
| `/assistant` | ⚠️ Assistant Down | Same as chat page, backend stream health check fails (502) |
| `/editor` | ✅ Loads | Dev bypass works, Monaco loads, AI Chat interface present |
| `/success` | ✅ Looks Good | Order confirmed, styled well, but `orderId` missing in fetch – still renders fallback |
| Storefront | ✅ Loads | User store experience loads and appears functional |

---

## 🔌 Redis Check

```
sudo lsof -i :6379
```

Output:

```
COMMAND    PID  USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
redis-ser 1231 redis    6u  IPv4  22619      0t0  TCP localhost.localdomain:redis (LISTEN)
redis-ser 1231 redis    7u  IPv6  22620      0t0  TCP ip6-localhost:redis (LISTEN)
```

✔️ Redis is running, unclear which modules currently use it. May not affect assistant issue.

---

## 🧠 Assistant Errors (Chat & Lab)

- `502 Bad Gateway` from `/assistant/msg/chat` POST
- Unparsable HTML seen instead of JSON (stream error)
- Assistant fetch/health check consistently fails
- Lab chat shows `Error connecting to assistant`

---

## 🎨 UI Audit Summary

| Page | UI Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/chat` | Needs overhaul | Dark background okay, but has spacing issues and no chat animation |
| `/assistant` | Needs overhaul | Functional layout, needs button alignment and style polish |
| `/editor` | Barebones UI | Monaco loaded, terminal present, but layout/buttons need alignment |

---

## 🧾 Notes

- Redis was restarted in Docker but did not change assistant behavior
- Duplicate slug warning on blog is working properly (`E11000`)
- Blog deletion and curl injection both work correctly
- Image filters, featured check, product rendering all pass
