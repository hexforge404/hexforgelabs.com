# Engine Identity — Surface API
Surface Engine consumes heightmaps to produce functional, modular enclosure geometry for electronics (Raspberry Pi-first). The API is infrastructure, not a generic art or case generator.

## Scope Contract
- Phase 0 (Foundation) is complete; only bug fixes are allowed.
- Phase 1 focuses exclusively on Raspberry Pi enclosure fidelity (tolerances, interfaces, design language, thermal philosophy).
- No feature beyond Phase 1 may be implemented until explicitly scheduled.

## Out of Scope
Generic skins, decorative-only tiles, novelty enclosures, and non-Raspberry Pi phone ecosystems are locked out. Phone cases remain experimental only.
